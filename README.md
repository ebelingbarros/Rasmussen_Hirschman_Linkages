### Theoretical foundations

According to Hirschman (1977, p. 73) an industry's linkage effect may be seen as forces that facilitate investments decision through input-output relations. While backward linkages refer to these forces in input-supplying sectors, forward linkages refer to the investments that facilitated in industries that use that input, which are located upstream to it. Hirschman devised the linkages framework to challenge the worldview that also in economies that are scarcely supplied by factors of production and entrepreneurship, the market is the best coordinating institution of the process of economic development, for it does the best job in allocating the economy’s resources. 
Hirschman believed that for economic development, "finding optimal combinations for given resources for given resources and factors of production” and “enlisting for development purposes resources and abilities that are hidden, scattered, or badly utilized” was of secondary importance (Hirschman, 1992, pp. 56-7). 

He proposed an unbalanced growth strategy in which investment decisions - chiefly those taken by governments regarding large infraastructural projects - are relevant not only because they have short-term effects, through multiypliying relations, but also because of their effect on future investment decisions because that owed to these construcetd linkages (ibid). In this context, A project’s unintended consequences and broader economic and political complementarities also contribute to another sector's flourishing. Sometimes a project's unintended consequences may be fundamental for its sucess or it can have much larger developmental consequences than the project itself (Hirschman, 1967, pp. 161-5; Grabel, 2017, p. 37). In this context, particularly in developing economies, taking into account a project's or prospective industry's possible backward and forward linkages are fundamental criteria for choosing among contending alternatives, which permits to rank “economic activities in accordance with their igniting potential” (Hirschman, 1967, p. 177-8, 183). 

### The model

Based on the pioneer analysis developed by Leontief (1951), the theoretical approach adopted in this study is based on the input-output model, in which the economy»s total production (X) is the result of the sum of the production intended for   intermediate consumption   by   different   sectors   (Z)   and   demand,   which represents  to  what  extent  sector  j  used  goods  produced  by  sector  i  in  its  total 
production. That is, the input-output model shows the percentage of inputs sold to industry j by sector i in relation to the total production of sector j.(1)where expresses the inter-sectoral sales of sector i to sector j and expresses the total production of sector j. Relationship (2) can thus be demonstrated:(2)where A is the matrix of domestic technical coefficients and Y is the vector of final demand.  By  solving  this  equation,  the  total  output  required  to  meet  the  final demand can be determined, i.e., (3):  (3)where is the inverse of Leontief»s matrix.Using  Leontief»s  model,  various  analyses  can  be  carried  out  to  assess  the impact of demand variation on production, employment and value added, among other variables. Based on the ratio between the value of the variable assumed7as K and  the  total  production  of  the  corresponding  sector,  the  direct  coefficient  (k)  is calculated for each variable(4)Once kis  calculated,  along  with  Leontief»s  inverse  matrix  (L),  one  can calculate, by sector, the amount directly and indirectly generated from variable K for  each  monetary  unit  produced  for  final  demand.  This  is  the  generator  notion, which relates production for final demand with a given variable of the economy. Thus, the generator of a variable K for each sector can be calculated by summing each column of matrix GK obtained in (5)

With the quotient between the generator and respective direct coefficient, one can obtain the multiplier of the variable assumed as K, which associates the direct effect of a variable with its total (direct and indirect) effect on the economy, as represented in equation (6).(6)Multipliers   for   employment   and   production   can   thus   be   obtained8. Additionally,   the   input-output   methodology   allows   for   other   indicators   of economic importance to be calculated. Following the seminal works of Hirschman (1958)  and  Rasmussen  (1956),  one  can  define  the  interrelationships  between  the sectors and the power of each sector in the economy to establish linkages. The so-called Hirschman-Rasmussen backward linkage (BL) indexes determine how much a  sector  demands  from  other  sectors,  and  the  rates  of  forward  linkages  (FL) determine  how  much  this  sector  is  demanded  by  other  sectors.  To  calculate  the Hirschman-Rasmussen backward linkage index, one defines as the elements of matrix   L, as the average of all the elements of L and as the sum of a column of L. The equation may be represented as(7)As  for  the  Hirschman-Rasmussen  forward  linkage  index,  it  is  calculated from  the  matrix  of  coefficients  in  row  (F)  obtained  from  the  intermediate consumption matrix (Z), as represented in (8).(8)As in Leontief»s inverse matrix, the matrix of Ghost is deduced with /|}(9)Considering as the average of all the elements of G and as the sum of the  elements  in  each  row,  the  Hirschman-Rasmussen  forward  linkage  index  is obtained


Depending  on  the  result  of  the indexes,  sectors  can  be  classified  into  four groups, namely, (i) independent from (or not very related to) other sectors, if both linkage  indexes  are  less  than  1;  (ii)  dependent  on  (or  strongly  related  to)  other sectors, if both linkage indexes are greaterthan 1, denoting sectors that are seen as playing a key role in the economy; (iii) dependent on inter-sectoral supply, if only the backward linkage index is greater than 1; and (iv) dependent on inter-sectoral demand,  if  only  the  forward  linkage  index  is greater  than  1.    However,  as  first observed  by  Cella  (1984)  and  Clements  (1990),  these  indexes  do  not  take  into account the production levels of each analyzed sector.
