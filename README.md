# Rasmussen_Hirschman_Linkages

Hirschman (1977, p. 73) defines an industry's linkage effect as the forces that facilitate investments it set into motion through input-output relations. While backward linkages refer to novel rounds of investment in input-supplying sectors, forward linkages refer to investments facilitated in industries that use that input. In the energy industry, a backward linkage refers to the demand for goods and services that the chain supplies to that industry, and a forward linkage refers mostly to energy, ideally cheaply priced and in abundant quantities, as input to a firm’s production endeavor. Besides backward and forward linkages, the author also refers to “fiscal linkages,” why refer to the flow of rents that accrue from the resource-rich sector to the state, in the form of taxes and other proceeds (ibid, p. 73). Fiscal linkages are part of the broader linkages framework, for they permit the forging of stable backward and forward linkages in the economy if taxation policy is efficient. This may occur with a time lag if society chooses to postpone investment decisions. In successful Energy Developmentalist projects, countries forge potent backward and forward between the booming resource sector and the rest of the economy, particularly the manufacturing sector.  The more efficient the fiscal linkages the country’s fiscal authority manages to forge with the resource sector, the larger the probability of successful Energy developmentalist projects.
Hirschman devised his linkages framework to contest the worldview that also in an economy scarcely supplied by factors of production and entrepreneurship, it would be best to leave to the market coordinating the process of economic development by allocating the economy’s resources. In contrast to this view, Hirschman believed that to steer economic development, it was secondary to “finding optimal combinations for given resources for given resources and factors of production” and “enlisting for development purposes resources and abilities that are hidden, scattered, or badly utilized” (Hirschman, 1992, pp. 56-7). The author proposes an unbalanced growth strategy in which investment decisions are important not only because of their short-term effects but also because of their effect on future investment decisions because of linkages (ibid). The chosen project’s unintended consequences and broader economic and political complementarities also contribute to another’s flourishing. In some contexts, a project's unintended consequences may be decisive for the project’s consecution or have much more significant developmental consequences than the project itself (Hirschman, 1967, pp. 161-5; Grabel, 2017, p. 37). In developing economies, the existence of backward and forward linkages are criteria for choosing among contending alternative projects or industrial sectors, allowing to rank “economic activities in accordance with their igniting potential” (Hirschman, 1967, p. 177-8, 183). In these countries, the state steps in and helps allocate scarce resources between rivaling projects and sectors, thus choosing those sectors that have potentially the strongest linkages. In this chapter, it will be seen that the energy sector has been chosen as a priority sector very frequently.  

Based on the pioneer analysis developed by Leontief (1951), the theoretical approach adopted in this study is based on the input-output model, in which the economy»s total production (X) is the result of the sum of the production intended for   intermediate consumption   by   different   sectors   (Z)   and   demand,   which represents  to  what  extent  sector  j  used  goods  produced  by  sector  i  in  its  total 
production. That is, the input-output model shows the percentage of inputs sold to industry j by sector i in relation to the total production of sector j.(1)where expresses the inter-sectoral sales of sector i to sector j and expresses the total production of sector j. Relationship (2) can thus be demonstrated:(2)where A is the matrix of domestic technical coefficients and Y is the vector of final demand.  By  solving  this  equation,  the  total  output  required  to  meet  the  final demand can be determined, i.e., (3):  (3)where is the inverse of Leontief»s matrix.Using  Leontief»s  model,  various  analyses  can  be  carried  out  to  assess  the impact of demand variation on production, employment and value added, among other variables. Based on the ratio between the value of the variable assumed7as K and  the  total  production  of  the  corresponding  sector,  the  direct  coefficient  (k)  is calculated for each variable(4)Once kis  calculated,  along  with  Leontief»s  inverse  matrix  (L),  one  can calculate, by sector, the amount directly and indirectly generated from variable K for  each  monetary  unit  produced  for  final  demand.  This  is  the  generator  notion, which relates production for final demand with a given variable of the economy. Thus, the generator of a variable K for each sector can be calculated by summing each column of matrix GK obtained in (5)

With the quotient between the generator and respective direct coefficient, one can obtain the multiplier of the variable assumed as K, which associates the direct effect of a variable with its total (direct and indirect) effect on the economy, as represented in equation (6).(6)Multipliers   for   employment   and   production   can   thus   be   obtained8. Additionally,   the   input-output   methodology   allows   for   other   indicators   of economic importance to be calculated. Following the seminal works of Hirschman (1958)  and  Rasmussen  (1956),  one  can  define  the  interrelationships  between  the sectors and the power of each sector in the economy to establish linkages. The so-called Hirschman-Rasmussen backward linkage (BL) indexes determine how much a  sector  demands  from  other  sectors,  and  the  rates  of  forward  linkages  (FL) determine  how  much  this  sector  is  demanded  by  other  sectors.  To  calculate  the Hirschman-Rasmussen backward linkage index, one defines as the elements of matrix   L, as the average of all the elements of L and as the sum of a column of L. The equation may be represented as(7)As  for  the  Hirschman-Rasmussen  forward  linkage  index,  it  is  calculated from  the  matrix  of  coefficients  in  row  (F)  obtained  from  the  intermediate consumption matrix (Z), as represented in (8).(8)As in Leontief»s inverse matrix, the matrix of Ghost is deduced with /|}(9)Considering as the average of all the elements of G and as the sum of the  elements  in  each  row,  the  Hirschman-Rasmussen  forward  linkage  index  is obtained


Depending  on  the  result  of  the indexes,  sectors  can  be  classified  into  four groups, namely, (i) independent from (or not very related to) other sectors, if both linkage  indexes  are  less  than  1;  (ii)  dependent  on  (or  strongly  related  to)  other sectors, if both linkage indexes are greaterthan 1, denoting sectors that are seen as playing a key role in the economy; (iii) dependent on inter-sectoral supply, if only the backward linkage index is greater than 1; and (iv) dependent on inter-sectoral demand,  if  only  the  forward  linkage  index  is greater  than  1.    However,  as  first observed  by  Cella  (1984)  and  Clements  (1990),  these  indexes  do  not  take  into account the production levels of each analyzed sector.
